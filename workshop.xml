	description="Welcome to Squirrelly's Chemical Curiosities, a massive expansion of the alchemy system, and also a sort of sequel/remastering of Evaisa's Arcane Alchemy!! 

Note: Arcane Alchemy is not compatible, because all of that code is pretty much there already.

Comes packed with 80+ materials, 200+ reactions, alchemy-related spells, items, and even an entire ore-generation system!!

A few of the (very) many things added:
