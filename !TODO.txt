Urgent:
-Look into tinker effect not working
-Add Shader and Audio effects for Dull Fungus effect
-Add damage to Hydroxide Ice
-Fix Alchemy Journal

New Features:
-Growth Potion (glitchy liquid, gives glitchy status with animated distorted player animations)
-Add Iron Stomach interactions for some materials (eg Veilium blocks blindness, Twitchy Liquid blocks twitchy debuff, Frozen Meat blocks colour blindness)
-Finalise Chaotic Pandorium
-Think of things for Terror Mode
-Add Runestone of Spells (converts things to ~~Chaotic~~ Pandorium (chaotic would be too much, might even scrap the idea in general))
-Make Runestone of Nullification spawn a small amount of Nullium where spells are neutralised
-Local Failshift perk, triggers a local shift when near dangerous materials
-Add interactions or something to some materials to make them less useless (like the slowdown potions)
-Subway Surfer.
-Frostburn effect makes you temporarily immune to Freezing Vapour
-Unstable Teleportatium under a Holy Mountain Portal makes you tp somewhere random in the next biome, has a 2% chance to replace the regular Teleportatium
-Spectrolium, gives an effect similar to Shimmer from Terraria, infinite flight when you have it
-Make Unstable Teleportatium teleport you to a random part of the eye room- just as a hint that UTele yields slightly different results than Tele

Fixes/Reworks:
-Fix Veilium effect being too snappy
-Uranium Reimplementation
-Ores Rework (speckles and chunks)
-Finish getting the settings menu finished and fully functional
-Rework Item and Pixel Scene generation with branches in mind

Under Consideration:
-Alchemist Settings controls
-Base Potion interactions
-Invisibilum interactions (invisibilum is taken over by non-magical liquids, maybe some magical ones too)
-Void overtakes Love
-Material Projectile Immunity perk (would not work on like giga-blackhole or something, might work on disc projectiles from Slicing Liquid)
-Item that opens a one-way portal to a neighbouring PW (if you are coming from Main World, you get warped back shortly and the portal closes)

Terror Mode:
-Terrorportium, chooses 5 destinations to teleport the player and then chooses the most dangerous one based on nearby materials and/or enemies
-Terrifying Pandorium, Unstable Pandorium Spells with Chaotic Pandorium Modifiers
-Terrifying Water, picks a random material based on the seed to convert to when the player is near (component on player that converts twater in a small circle around them, about the size of a Touch Of spell, maybe smaller)
-Material-born projectiles home in on the player?

Compatibility:
-Finish Anvil of Destiny compatibility
 -Potentially switch to working on an Anvil of Destiny Overwrite
-Finish Conjurer Compatibility
