New Features:
-Growth Potion (glitchy liquid, gives glitchy status with animated distorted player animations)
-Add Iron Stomach interactions for some materials (eg Veilium blocks blindness, Twitchy Liquid blocks twitchy debuff, Frozen Meat blocks colour blindness)
-Finish Chaotic Pandorium
-Think of things for Terror Mode
-Add Runestone of Spells (converts things to Chaotic Pandorium)
-Make Runestone of Nullification spawn a small amount of Nullium where spells are neutralised
-Local Failshift perk, triggers a local shift when near dangerous materials
-Add interactions or something to some materials to make them less useless (like the slowdown potions)

Fixes/Reworks:
-Fix Veilium effect being too snappy
-Uranium Reimplementation
-Ores Rework
-Finish getting the settings menu finished and fully functional

Under Consideration:
-Alchemist Settings controls
-Base Potion interactions
-Invisibilum interactions (invisibilum is taken over by non-magical liquids, maybe some magical ones too)
-Void overtakes Love
-Material Projectile Immunity perk (would not work on like giga-blackhole or something, might work on disc projectiles from Slicing Liquid)

Terror Mode:
-Terrorportium, chooses 5 destinations to teleport the player and then chooses the most dangerous one based on nearby materials and/or enemies
-Terrifying Pandorium, Unstable Pandorium Spells with Chaotic Pandorium Modifiers
-Terrifying Water, picks a random material based on the seed to convert to when the player is near (component on player that converts twater in a small circle around them, about the size of a Touch Of spell, maybe smaller)
-Material-born projectiles home in on the player?

Compatibility:
-Finish Anvil of Destiny compatibility
-Finish Conjurer compatibility


scrapped:

Fluent Fluids Expansion (gonna make it its own mod, -UserK)
-Liquid Gases
-More Explosive Canisters for different liquids
-Powder Liquids? (i think this could be cool)
