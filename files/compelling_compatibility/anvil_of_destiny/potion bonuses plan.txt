Potion + Wand = Potion Bonus
Potion + Tablet + Wand = Potion Ability/Primary? (can only have 1)

Do this by Potion + Wand running [material] function and Potion + Tablet + Wand running enhanced_[material]
This way it can check for each the same way, will require a check for tablet consumption in the case that the given material does not have an enhanced_ script ver
(this can likely be done by checking if the script enhanced_[material] exists, and disabling the tablet input if so.)



Pouring Hungry Slime on the anvil causes it to consume it and turn into Divine Slime (anvil will still break when enough is consumed)
(this was mostly added since its impossible to have hungry slime not eat the anvil, so we might as well have it be special in some way)
no idea what function this will serve


The material the anvil transmutes into when it breaks is now Divine Magma instead of Lava (Divine Magma will be overtaken/diluted by Lava the same way Invisibilium is by Water)
no idea what function this will serve



Pouring Nullium on the anvil will slightly corrode it, but generally won't be enough to break it unless you have several flasks
(this is to partially hint at and continue the theme that Nullium damages the anvil, as seen later)


Using Nullium potion on the anvil kills it (all entities relating to it (converter, damage checker, anything script-related) are removed leaving only the physical anvil itself)
This allows the player to make Divine Slime without half the anvil turning into Divine "data/materials_gfx/magic_gate.png"

Do this via potion bonus with special field "potion must come first" or whatever (to prevent wands from being encased within the anvil forever)
Alternatively, Wand can be gotten back, but will have 0 Max Mana and 0 Mana Charge Speed
